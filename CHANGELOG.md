Features in the latest push to this release:

administrators of the shop
* A message displays below the cart to indicate whether the purchase is eligible to monthly installments
* The module adds a payment method to the checkout, which redirects the user to Alma's payment page.
If everything goes right (i.e. Customer doesn't cancel, pays the right amount, ... ), the order is validated upon customer return.
