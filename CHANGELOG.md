v1.0.0
------
This version evolved for a while without any version bump 🤷‍♂️
Features in the latest push to this release:

* Module can be configured in Test and Live mode; Test mode only shows Alma's payment method to visitors who are also
administrators of the shop
* A message displays below the cart to indicate whether the purchase is eligible to monthly installments
* The module adds a payment method to the checkout, which redirects the user to Alma's payment page.
If everything goes right (i.e. Customer doesn't cancel, pays the right amount, ... ), the order is validated upon customer return.
