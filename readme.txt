This plugin adds a new payment method to WooCommerce, which allows you to offer monthly payments to your customer using Alma.

== Description ==

[Alma](https://almapay.com) is a service to provide merchants with an **easy** and **safe** monthly payments solution.
Let your customers pay for their purchases at their own pace! You'll receive the funds instantly, and your customer will pay later over a few monthly instalments.

This plugin integrates Alma into WooCommerce by adding a new payment method that you can activate to offer monthly payments to your customers.

== Installation ==

= Prerequisites =

You first need to create your merchant account on [dashboard.getalma.eu](https://dashboard.getalma.eu) and activate your account.

= Configuring the plugin =

After installing the plugin, go to WooCommerce settings and activate the new Alma payment method.
You should be redirected to the payment method settings upon activation.

Fill in the API keys for your account, which you can find on your dashboard's [security page](https://dashboard.getalma.eu/security).

After you save your API keys, you'll have access to different settings to control what the plugin should display on the Cart and Checkout pages.
We advise you to stay in "Test" mode until you're happy with your configuration and are ready to accept payments from your customers.

Once everything is properly set up, go ahead and switch to "Live" mode!
